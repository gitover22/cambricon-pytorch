/**
 * Note [viewChainFuser]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * viewChainFuser is aimed to fuse a large number of view nodes into a small
 * number of view nodes. Which will save a lot of running time of IO operators
 * on the device.
 * 
 * So there are two principles:
 * 1) If IO kernel is reduce IO data volume, we need to move this IO kernel forward in
 * view chain. Otherwise we need to move this IO kernel backward in view chain. 
 * 2) If same IO kernels in adjacent positions, we need to fused them to one IO kernel.
 * 
 * Operation stages:
 * Stage one:
 * This is Default optimization, which call fusion optimization, replace optimization and
 * movement optimization.
 * a. By viewing the whole view chain, the visible contiguous view node are fused to one node.
 *    This will simplify the movement between multiple nodes;
 * b. By circle the whole view chain to check each node, and replace a IO view node to reshape
 *    view node according to certain rules;
 * c. Accoding to the type of each node, we are trying to move view node to different position
 *    in the view chain.
 *    1) Try to move slice to the top of view chain, which include some movement optimizations to
 *       exchange positions.;
 *       Like: permute + slice -> slice + permute;
 *             expand + slice -> slice + expand;
 *             reshape + slice -> slice + reshape.
 *    2) Try to move expand to the bottom of view chain;
 *       Like: expand + permute -> permute + expand;
 *             expand + reshape -> reshape + expand.
 *    3) Try to move reshape output of two permute node.
 *       Like: permute + reshape + permute -> reshape + permute + permute
 *          or permute + reshape + permute -> permute + permute + reshape
 * 
 * Stage two:
 * Each time we push two view nodes to obtain a better combination. Assuming two same view op
 * is met, fused those to one view node. Otherwise nothing will change.
 * Like: permute + permute -> permute
 *       slice + slice -> slice and so no.
 *
 * Stage three:
 * Each time we push one view node to obtain replace one, which is using shared storage to
 * reduce IO operator.
 * Like: permute -> reshape
 * 
 * Limited:
 * unfold and diagonal view node is not supported now.
 * 
 * example: 
 * original view chain: permute --> slice --> permute
 * after fused view chain: slice --> permute
 * 
 * original view chain: permute --> slice --> expand --> permute
 * after fused view chain: slice --> permute --> expand
 * 
 * original view chain: permute --> reshape --> reshape --> permute
 * after fused view chain: permute
 * 
 * Why we need do this?
 * IO operators running time is decided by IO data volume, so we need to reduce IO
 * data volume by moving IO operator position or fused IO same(or almost same) operator.
 * 
 * More view node details you can find in torch_mlu/csrc/aten/cnnl/baseViewOps.h
 * More view chain details you can find in torch_mlu/csrc/aten/cnnl/viewChain.h
