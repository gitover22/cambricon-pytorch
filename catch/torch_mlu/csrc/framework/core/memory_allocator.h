/**
 * Note [HostMemoryAllocator]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * A host caching allocator is to hold MLU host page-locked memory.
 * Which is designed for re-uses freed pinned (page-locked) memory,
 * and avoid too many time-used api call. Like cnrtHostMalloc, cnrtFreeHost.
 *
 * Also Caching allocator tries to avoid allocating and freeing memory for each use
 * for performance reasons. Resources only be freed by explicitly clearing the cache or
 * at the teardown of process.
 * https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/why-dont-explicit-free-cpu-resource-in-cachinghostallocator/189714
 * 
 * Also can get more details in [CUDAHostAllocator design]
 * https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/release/1.13/aten/src/ATen/cuda/CachingHostAllocator.cpp#L116
 *
 * Note1: To ensure correct behavior, MLUCachingHostAllocator_recordEvent must be
 * called anytime a pointer from this allocator is used.
 * Example:
 *   {
 *     at::DataPtr ptr = getMLUCachingHostAllocator()->allocate(size);
 *     // do something
 *     MLUCachingHostAllocator_recordEvent(ptr.get(), ptr.get_context(), queue);
 *   }
 * 
 * Note2: when you add new public function in this class, you may
 * need add a lock guard protection.
 *
 * Note3: that this allocator does not split larger allocations into smaller
 * blocks, unlike the caching device allocator.
 *
